Overview : Applicants selection with the best chance of success in their ventures

Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions:

Data Preprocessing

What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
    The varibale used was if the organization is succesful

What variable(s) are the features for your model?
    The income amount and asking amount 

What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
    EIN,	NAME,	APPLICATION_TYPE,	AFFILIATION	CLASSIFICATION	

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
    3 neurons and 3  layers becasue it provided the the minimum success prediction.

Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
    Yes
What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
    I changed CLASSIFICATION to IS_SUCCESSFUL

Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation
 for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.
    Utilizing the data set and relu model and prediction that was greater than the requirement.  
    I also used different optimizers which provided prediction greater thna the requirement. 
    I reccomend using any of the provided models because of their high accuracy.
